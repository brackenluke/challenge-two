        <p>
          Hello, my name is Luke! Currently residing in San Antonio. Lived about six years in Kentucky, and enjoyed it.
          I really love going fishing, and love camping out in nature. I am the father of two wonderful kids. Most of my 
          work experience so far has been in restaurants. My career in the hospitality and service industry started as a 
          dishwasher at a chinese place. From there, I started bussing and helping run food for the servers. Eventually, 
          I went on to other places working as a server, banquet server, and more. I've worked just about every position
          front and back house. I recently resigned my position as GM at a smoothie shop in town, and I am looking forward to new
          possibilities in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          My new career in the tech field started with me taking a coding bootcamp at UTSA. Using the knowledge and experience
          I gain in the course, I expect to gain a better understanding of how to find work in the tech field and to succeed doing so. 
          Currently, I am interested in web development or becoming a software engineer in the near future. Hopefully, with the new 
          career path, I'll feel more satisfaction and pride in my worklife.
        </p>
